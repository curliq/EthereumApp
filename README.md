# EthereumApp

The app is written in Kotlin so Android Studio 3 is required to run it.

Features backlog:
- New section called "News" that shows current news about ethereum from Google or any other sources
- Show price when clicking on different points in the chart
- Change chart's currency 
- Add more currencies in the wallets

Feel free to commit any improvements, or to create a feature branch.
